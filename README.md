# 100-Days-of-DSA

## Folder Structure
* 100-day-dsa-challenge/: contains all the code I write during the challenge.
* 100-day-dsa-challenge/day-1/ to 100-day-dsa-challenge/day-100/: contains the code for each day's problem.
## Rules
* I will write code for a different problem each day for 100 days.
* Each day, I will write code for at least one problem from the list of problems that I have curated.
* I will commit and push the code for each day's problem to this repository.
* I will try to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.


By participating in this 100-day DSA code challenge, I hope to improve my coding skills, become more comfortable with data structures and algorithms, and develop good coding habits.
